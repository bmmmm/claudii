## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`claudii vibemap`** (opt-in activity heatmap): logs one TSV line per cc-statusline render to `~/.cache/claudii/vibemap.tsv` (default off — set `vibemap.enabled=true` to start tracking), then renders ASCII heatmaps over the data. Two views: `claudii vibemap` shows a weekday × 3-hour-bin grid (Mon–Sun × 00-03..21-00), `claudii vibemap strip [--days N]` shows the last N days × 24 hours per row. Both color the bedtime window in red so overdue vibing patterns surface visually. Plus `vibemap status` (enabled/path/entry-count/oldest-entry), `vibemap path`, and `vibemap clear` for full lifecycle control. Schema: `epoch \t weekday \t hour \t minute \t model \t sid8 \t delta_ms` — local-only, never transmitted, no prompt content stored. Aggregation done in pure awk (`lib/vibemap-{grid,strip}.awk`), presentation in `lib/cmd/vibemap.sh`, logging hook in `lib/vibemap.sh` (used by both the CLI and the cc-statusline append path).
- **`clock` segment with bedtime nudge**: Renders local wall-clock time + a glyph that escalates as bedtime approaches and passes — `☾ 22:14` dim, → cyan 30 min out, → yellow at 10 min out, → blinking red `☾ 23:30 +30m` once past, → vibe-coma (per-character synthwave rainbow + rotating glyph from `💤 🌙 🦉 ✨ 🌌` + blink + a randomly-rotating shame string like `GO TO BED` / `TOUCH GRASS` / `FUTURE YOU SAYS NO`, all reshuffled every render) after the 1-hour overdue mark. Wrap-aware across midnight. Configurable via `statusline.bedtime` (HH:MM, default `23:00`). Add it to your `statusline.lines` layout to show.
- **`claudii vpnii set/clear/show`**: Wraps the WireGuard state-file write that wg-quick PostUp/PreDown hooks trigger. The CLI drops privilege from root to the real user (resolved via `SUDO_USER` → `/dev/console` owner → `$USER`, override with `--user <name>` or `CLAUDII_USER`), so `~/.cache/claudii/vpnii` is always owned by you — no more sudo to clean up after a missed PreDown. New wg conf shape: `PostUp = claudii vpnii set HomeLab` / `PreDown = claudii vpnii clear`. Old direct-write recipes still work but produce root-owned files.
- **Tailscale detection in cc-statusline + RPROMPT VPN segment**: Single `ifconfig` scan for an IPv4 in 100.64.0.0/10 (RFC 6598 CGNAT, Tailscale's range) — no daemon dependency, no `tailscale` CLI call. Renders `⬢ ts` next to the existing `⬡ <wg-tunnel>` when both are active. Both surfaces (cc-statusline and the zsh RPROMPT via `lib/vpnii.zsh`) use the same compact format. New symbol `CLAUDII_SYM_TAILSCALE="⬢"` in `lib/visual.sh`.
- **Incident age + bracket grouping in cc-statusline**: Model glyphs are now wrapped in `[…]` with the cache-mtime age and incident flag trailing outside, matching the RPROMPT format: `[Opus ✓ Sonnet ✓ Haiku ✓] 7m ⚐`. Without an active incident the brackets and trailing segment are omitted, preserving the bare `Opus ✓ Sonnet ✓ Haiku ✓` look. `bin/claudii-status` also persists `_incident_started=<epoch>` to the cache for downstream consumers.
- **Inverted rate display (`statusline.rate_display`)**: New config key — set to `remaining` to flip rate-5h / rate-7d from "used %" to "remaining %" (e.g. `5h:62%` becomes `5h↓:38%`). Session deltas flip sign too: `Δ5h:+12%` (used grew) becomes `Δ5h:−12%` (remaining shrank). The `↓` marker on the label distinguishes the modes at a glance (default `used` stays unmarked). The flip applies across cc-statusline, the precmd session dashboard, the `claudii` overview Account block, and `claudii se` rows. Colors and reset-countdown thresholds key off the underlying usage in both modes — "close to limit" still renders red whether shown as 86% used or 14% remaining.
- **Rate-limit color: green at low usage**: `_rlc` now uses green (`\033[32m`) instead of cyan (`\033[36m`) for the < 50% bucket. In remaining mode "97% remaining" reads as cyan was unintuitive — green matches the "lots of headroom" semantics cleanly. Also affects used mode, where low usage now reads green.

### Fixed
- **Rate-limit reset countdown format consistency**: The 5h reset always rendered in minutes (`↺79m`, `↺240m`) while 7d switched to hours (`↺1h`, `↺2d4h`). Both now use the same formatter: `Xm` < 60 minutes, `XhYm` (or `Xh` when minutes are zero) for 1–24 h, `XdYh` (or `Xd`) for 24 h+. So 79 minutes shows as `↺1h19m` for both windows instead of differing per limit.
- **Overview no longer aborts after Account header in `rate_display=remaining` mode**: `_cmd_default` built the 7d delta segment with `_ov_acct_line+=" (… $( (( _ov_delta_disp > 0 )) && echo "+" )${_ov_delta_disp}% …)"`. When `statusline.rate_display="remaining"` and the 7d rate had grown since the session started, the displayed delta got negated (`+3%` → `-3%`), the inline `(( ... ))` test failed, and its non-zero exit propagated through the `+=` assignment. `bin/claudii`'s `set -euo pipefail` then aborted the whole function right after the `● Account` header — Agents, Services, and Sessions blocks silently disappeared. Sign computation now runs in conditional context (`(( ... )) && _ov_sign="+"`) so the failing arithmetic test stays exempt from errexit. Regression test in `tests/test_cli.sh` covers the exact data shape (`remaining` mode + positive 7d delta with a live session).
- **Status check no longer flags all models for non-model incidents**: `bin/claudii-status` previously fell back to "mark every model as down" whenever the incident name didn't mention a model — which fired on incidents that have nothing to do with model availability (e.g. "Connection failures for organizations restricting GitHub access by IP address"). The cc-statusline rendered `Opus ↓ Sonnet ↓ Haiku ↓` and the launcher silently fell back from `clm` → sonnet. Parser now searches `name + incident_updates[].body + components[].name`; only flags models found there, plus a narrow safety net that flags all models when `components` lists the bare `API` entry (genuine inference outage). For everything else, `_incident=<status>` still gets persisted so the indicator (`⚐ Identified`, `‼ Investigating`, `◎ Monitoring`) still shows — only the per-model `↓` no longer lies.

### Refactored
- **Sessionline config read moved to top of script**: The four `statusline.*` keys (`lines`, `models`, `omlx_active_path`, `rate_display`) are now read in one `jq` call right after the cache-dir setup, before any segment processing. Lets later code (e.g. rate inversion) consume the config without forking a second `jq`.

### Removed
- **Local `Formula/claudii.rb`**: The local Formula was a duplicate of the one in `bmmmm/homebrew-tap`, kept solely so CI could run `brew audit --formula Formula/claudii.rb`. After the v0.16.0 drift incident the costs of that duplication outweighed the audit. The tap is now the single source of truth; `scripts/release.sh` updates it via the GitHub contents API at release time. The CI `brew audit` step is gone.

### Release pipeline
- **`scripts/release.sh` polling**: `_head=$(git rev-parse HEAD)` was captured AFTER the local Formula sync commit, so the workflow `head_sha` filter never matched. Replaced with `_tag_sha`, captured immediately after `git push origin <tag>`. The post-tag local commit no longer exists (Formula gone) but the fix stays for robustness.
- **Release notes extraction**: `release.yml` matched `## [${VERSION}]` (no v) but CHANGELOG headers carry the v-prefix (`## [v0.16.0]`). Awk now matches both forms.

---

## [v0.16.0] — 2026-05-06

### Added
- **`claudii omlx [status|connect|test|disconnect]`**: New top-level command for wiring up the [gateii](https://github.com/bmmmm/gateii) local-LLM agent layer to claudii's cc-statusline. `connect` detects the gateii data path (or stores a custom one via `statusline.omlx_active_path`), confirms the omlx segment is in the layout, and probes the oMLX server. `test` renders a synthetic `⚡ <task> <model> <Xs>` line for previewing. `disconnect` removes the segment from custom layouts.
- **Sessionline `omlx` segment**: New segment that reads gateii's `data/agents/active.json` (or env override `CLAUDII_OMLX_ACTIVE` / config `.statusline.omlx_active_path`) and renders `⚡ <task> <model-short> <Xs>` while a local omlx-backed agent is running. Empty (and the line is silently dropped) when no agent is active or gateii is not installed — zero impact for users without gateii.
- **Sessionline default layout: `omlx` line**: `_DEFAULT_LINES` (and `config/defaults.json`) now include `["omlx"]` as the 5th line. Users on the built-in default layout get the indicator automatically; users with a custom `.statusline.lines` need to add `["omlx"]` themselves or run `claudii omlx connect`.
- **Sessionline `effort.level` from JSON**: Model segment now reads reasoning effort from `effort.level` in the CC statusLine stdin JSON (available since CC v2.1.119), replacing the `CLAUDII_EFFORT` environment-variable workaround.
- **Sessionline thinking indicator**: When `thinking.enabled` is `true` in the statusLine JSON, a `▲` indicator is appended to the model segment.
- **Sessionline `workspace.git_worktree` fallback**: The `worktree` segment now falls back to `workspace.git_worktree` so it fires inside any linked git worktree, not just `--worktree` sessions.
- **Sessionline `dir` segment**: New segment showing `⌂ <dirname>` (dim text). Sources `worktree.original_cwd` in `--worktree` sessions, otherwise `workspace.project_dir`, with `workspace.current_dir` as last fallback. Added to default layout (line 3, after `worktree`).
- **Sessionline effort level coloring**: `effort.level` is now always displayed next to the model name, colored by tier — `max` in accent (pink), `high` in yellow, `medium`/`low` dim. Previously hidden when `high`.
- **Sessionline thinking indicator color**: The `▲` thinking indicator is now cyan instead of dim for better visibility.
- **Sessionline dir segment**: Directory name now rendered in yellow; prefix symbol `⌂` stays dim.
- **Spinner mode dispatch + 5 new modes**: `_spinner_start` resolves the mode once from env `CLAUDII_SPINNER_MODE` or config `ui.spinner` (default `random`) and exports it, so the spinner loop never spawns jq. New modes: `dots` (cyan braille rotation), `pulse` (gray brightness sweep), `bounce` (green dot in a track), `arc` (pink quarter-circles), `orbit` (purple braille pairs). The previously dormant `wave` mode is now wired into the random rotation. Set `claudii config set ui.spinner <mode>` to pin one, or leave it on `random` for variety.

### Fixed
- **`lib/log.sh` not sourced by plugin**: `lib/functions.zsh` calls `_claudii_log` at seven sites but `claudii.plugin.zsh` only sourced `visual.sh`, `config.zsh`, `functions.zsh`, `statusline.zsh` — never `log.sh`. Calls failed silently in interactive zsh sessions. Fixed by adding `source lib/log.sh` to the plugin entry.
- **Sessionline default layout: `agent` removed from line 4**: CC already shows the session name natively; the `agent` segment is still available for custom layouts but no longer shown by default.
- **`config/defaults.json` drift with `_DEFAULT_LINES` (round 2)**: The proxy/reshuffle commit updated `_DEFAULT_LINES` in `bin/claudii-sessionline` but not `config/defaults.json`. Since `_cfg_init` copies `defaults.json` to `~/.config/claudii/config.json` on first run, any user who triggered config init received the *old* layout, which then overrode the new in-script default. Synced both files again.
- **`config/defaults.json` drift with `_DEFAULT_LINES`**: The defaults file was missing `dir` (line 3) and `agent` (line 4) segments that the script's `_DEFAULT_LINES` had been advertising for several releases. `claudii config get statusline.lines` returned the stale list. Fixed by syncing both sources.
- **Overview: `model=` prefix in session dashboard** — the precmd session-dashboard extracted values from the session cache using `${sc#*$'\n'key=}`, which failed when `key=` was the first line (no leading newline). Fixed by prepending a newline before extraction (`_sc_nl=$'\n'"$sc"`), affecting model, ctx_pct, cost, rate_5h, and reset_5h display.
- **Overview: `reset Xmin` → `↺Xm`** — Account section reset countdowns now use the same `↺Xm` / `↺XdXh` format as the sessionline instead of the verbose `reset Xmin` / `reset Xd Xh` text.
- **Overview: agents trailing `/`** — Agents without a skill had their empty skill field eaten by `IFS=$'\t' read` (tab is bash whitespace — consecutive tabs collapse), causing columns to shift: `s=haiku m=high e=""` instead of `s="" m=haiku e=high`. Fixed by switching to `` (unit separator) as delimiter in jq/read, which is non-whitespace. Also fixed trailing `/` for agents without effort using conditional `model/effort` vs `model` formatting.

### Refactored
- **Sessionline jq calls on `config.json`**: Three separate `jq` invocations on the same config file (`statusline.lines`, `statusline.models`, `statusline.omlx_active_path`) collapsed into one. US (0x1F) separates the three values; RS (0x1E) separates rows inside `lines`, restored to `\n` in the shell. Saves two `jq` forks per cc-statusline render.
- **`claudii-status` jq calls on `$unresolved`**: Four separate `jq` invocations on the same incidents JSON (count, service level, names list, first-incident name) collapsed into one. Same US/RS scheme; embedded newlines in incident names are stripped to spaces inside `jq` so `read -r` does not truncate.

### Removed
- **`CLAUDII_SYM_CACHE` constant**: Defined in `lib/visual.sh` but never referenced (the sessionline used the literal `⚡` directly). Removed.

## [v0.15.0] — 2026-04-17

### Security
- **Sessions cache injection (awk):** Prevented awk code injection via unescaped session names in `_parse_session_cache` and three other sites where glob results are passed to awk — all now quote glob results and bracket `$1` references
- **Sessionline ANSI injection:** `echo -e` with user-controlled session names now uses `printf %s` — prevents embedded escape sequences from being interpreted
- **Token-in-URL:** Anthropic API key no longer visible in cURL/log output during `scripts/release.sh` SHA256 validation — replaced curl with python3
- **Config eval validation:** Agent names validated before `eval` to prevent code injection via crafted aliases
- **`_tok` awk injection:** Token-formatting helper now passes value via `-v` instead of string-interpolation — untrusted token counts can no longer inject awk code
- **Agent name hyphen + reserved-name guard:** Aliases containing hyphens or shadowing built-ins (`cd`, `ls`, etc.) are rejected before `eval`
- **Status feed size cap:** `curl --max-filesize 1m` on unresolved.json / RSS prevents memory exhaustion on oversize responses

### Fixed
- **Session cost/timestamp arithmetic:** Float `$*_mtime` (milliseconds from `epoch_to_date`) now handled in bash arithmetic via explicit rounding — `reset_5h` and `reset_7d` no longer fail on non-integer timestamps
- **Stat macOS-first:** `stat` invocation order corrected throughout (`-x` macOS flag before positional args); applied to `lib/statusline.zsh`, `lib/config.zsh`, and helper functions
- **Atomic writes:** All config/cache updates now use `mktemp` + `mv` pattern (was inline jq writes) — config file can no longer be silently wiped on jq error; added to `install.sh`, `claudii-status`, and sessionline cache updates
- **Sessionline GC file read:** Misplaced `2>/dev/null` removed from `if [[ ! -f ... ]]` condition — error suppression no longer hides permission errors
- **Context percentage unclamped:** `ctx_pct` now capped at 100 to prevent display of `>100%` due to rounding edge cases
- **Session age rendering:** `_render_age` now handles negative values from clock skew without crashing
- **Session cache by mtime:** `latest_5h` now uses cache file `mtime` instead of glob order — ensures correct 5-hour window detection on slow filesystems
- **`claudii update` exit code:** Now correctly exits 1 when brew/git commands fail (was returning 0 on syntax error in update check)
- **Sessionline orphaned arrow:** `↑` indicator now hidden when `input_tok=0` (no pending input)
- **`cc-statusline` usage to stderr:** Help text now printed to stderr, not stdout (consistent with other CLI tools)
- **ClaudeStatus RSS parsing:** Title pattern widened to match Anthropic's incident wording variations; jq type guard added to prevent crashes when API response lacks expected fields; RSS title now word-anchored to prevent `opus` matching `opus-3`-style substrings
- **Status test vacuous:** Removed exit-code test in `test_status.sh` that was silently passing when function didn't execute
- **Performance:** Removed awk subprocess spawning in precmd hook (cost=0 history fallback for performance)
- **Session ctx_pct regex:** Weak `^[0-9]` accepted `"50abc"` and leaked non-numeric into arithmetic — strengthened to `^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$`, added lower clamp; same validation applied to `rate5h` display path
- **Model word-anchoring in trends/sessions awk:** `/[Oo]pus/` substring match would misclassify fictional names like `sonnet-opus-hybrid` — replaced with word-anchored regex in both `sessions.sh` and `display.sh`
- **`claudii doctor` exit code:** Always returned 0 even when checks failed, breaking CI/automation — now returns 1 if any check is `fail`, in both text and JSON modes
- **history.tsv parse hardening:** awk now strips CR from fields (defense against CRLF-synced files) and guards `NF < 6` short rows in `trends` and `sessions` aggregations
- **Incident name newline strip:** Multi-line incident names from `unresolved.json` flattened via `tr '\n' ' '` — prevents broken RPROMPT/stderr layout
- **`config import` reserved names:** `claudii`, `claude`, `clh` now rejected at import time — previously slipped through to shell registration and broke subcommand dispatch silently
- **Plugin bootstrap `print -P %` expansion:** `claudii.plugin.zsh` now uses `printf` instead of `print -P` — prevents prompt-escape expansion on paths containing `%`
- **Portable shebangs:** `scripts/release.sh` and `scripts/check-session-cost.sh` switched to `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

### Changed
- **Session lookup errors:** Error messages now show what was searched (ID, name, pattern) with hints on how to fix
- **Config key validation:** Actionable error when setting non-existent keys — suggests valid alternatives and shows current config
- **Atomic jq-write pattern:** Extracted into `_jq_update()` helper, replaces 14 inline instances across `system.sh` and `config.sh`
- **Test runner `--summary` flag:** `bash tests/run.sh --summary` prints a single-line pass/fail total — cuts token usage in agent loops (582 passes → 1 line instead of ~800)
- **CLAUDE.md token-efficiency guide:** New section documents re-Read avoidance, batched Edits, agent-prompt caps, verify-before-fix

### Tests
- 20 new tests added for `claudii pin`, `claudii unpin`, `claudii resume` (test_pin_resume.sh)
- Regression tests: `_tok` awk injection, `config import` reserved-name guard, incident-name newline flattening, `trends`/`sessions` CRLF + short-row guards, doctor non-zero exit on failure

---

## [v0.14.0] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **ClaudeStatus:** `unresolved.json` replaces `components.json` as primary source — authoritative active-incident list, no HTML parsing required. RSS remains fallback when API unreachable.
- **ClaudeStatus:** PID recycling guard in `_claudii_status_spawn` — `kill -0` alone can match unrelated processes that reused the PID; now also checks `status.pid` mtime (> 30s → recycled) to ensure only our actual job is counted as running
- **Sessionline:** `pinned=` flag now preserved on every cache update — was silently dropped when session cache was rewritten atomically
- **`_parse_session_cache`:** Removed dead fields `model_id` and `burn_eta` (no callers); `mv` → `mv -f` for consistent atomic overwrites
- **`cleanup-worktree.sh --all`:** Active worktrees with uncommitted changes or unmerged commits are now skipped instead of deleted — prevents accidental removal of in-progress agent work across parallel sessions. `--force` overrides.
- **Formula:** Local `Formula/claudii.rb` was stuck on v0.1.0; `scripts/release.sh` now syncs it on every release alongside the Homebrew tap.

### Changed
- **`scripts/cleanup-worktree.sh`:** `--all` flag removes all zombie `agent-*` dirs in one call; zombie dirs (no `.git` file) cleaned via `rm -rf` fallback (not `git worktree remove` — they aren't registered)
- **ClaudeStatus adaptive TTL:** Cache refresh interval now adjusts based on last known status — all-ok → `ttl × 2` (600s default), incident → `max(60, ttl / 5)` (60s default); halves external calls in normal conditions, doubles check frequency during incidents. Base TTL default corrected from stale 900s to 300s.

---

## [v0.13.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- **`claudii gc`:** Manual session garbage collection — removes ended sessions that exceed the configured keep count
- **`claudii resume <id>`:** Print the `claude -r <uuid>` command for a session by short ID or index

### Fixed
- **ClaudeStatus:** Resolved incident detection now correctly matches HTML-encoded RSS entities (`&lt;strong&gt;`) — previously matched nothing, causing all recent incidents (including resolved ones) to trigger false degraded state
- **ClaudeStatus:** `claudii status` no longer aborts silently under `set -e` when models are degraded — added `|| true` to status check call
- **Config:** `claudii config set` now auto-creates nested parent paths using `setpath` — previously failed silently on missing intermediate keys
- **Config:** Search model/effort falls back through `search.*` → `aliases.clq.*` → hardcoded default
- **Sessions:** `claudii pin`/`unpin` use atomic `tmp+mv` write — eliminates race with concurrent sessionline rewrites
- **`claudii status`:** Removed duplicate incident display block

### Changed
- **Internal:** Extracted `_collect_history_files`, `_date_init`, `_spinner_start/stop` helpers from `bin/claudii` — reduces duplication across cost/trends/sessions commands
- **`scripts/cleanup-worktree.sh`:** Added `--all` flag and zombie dir support — handles physical dirs not registered in git worktree list

---

## [v0.12.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- **CC-Statusline:** New `claude-status` segment (default line 4) — shows model health indicators (`Opus ✓  Sonnet ✓  Haiku ✓`) from the ClaudeStatus cache directly inside Claude Code
- **History rotation:** Flight Recorder now writes monthly files (`history-YYYY-MM.tsv`) — prevents unbounded growth, old `history.tsv` still read for backward compat
- **Dynamic aliases:** Shell aliases (`cl`, `clo`, `clm`, `clq`) now registered dynamically from `aliases.*` in config — add/remove aliases without editing code
- **`claudii pin/unpin`:** Protect inactive sessions from garbage collection — pinned sessions show `⊡` badge in `claudii si`, stale sessions marked with `stale` tag
- **Shared epoch_to_date:** Deduplicated awk date function into `lib/epoch_to_date.awk`

### Removed
- **`claudii watch`** — Background notification watcher removed. Rate-limit info is already visible in Sessionline and Dashboard. Slot reserved for a better notification mechanism in the future.

### Changed
- **Internal:** Atomic jq-write pattern extracted into `_jq_update()` helper — replaces 14 inline instances across `system.sh` and `config.sh`
- **Internal:** Session JSONL lookup uses `_session_build_map` + single-pass `_session_resolve` — one awk per session instead of 3 greps
- **i18n:** All user-facing strings translated to English (config descriptions, error messages, prompts, table headers)
- **`claudii help`:** Alias table now reads from `config/defaults.json` dynamically

### Fixed
- **Performance:** Removed awk subprocess spawning in precmd hook (cost=0 history fallback) — eliminates latency spikes when history.tsv is large
- **Performance:** `claudii status` no longer fetches RSS twice — reads cached `status-cache.xml` from previous `claudii-status` run
- **Performance:** Prevent duplicate `claudii-status` background spawns via PID lock file
- **ClaudeStatus:** RSS feed now always fetched alongside components API — catches incidents Anthropic hasn't yet reflected in component status (previously only fetched on non-operational signal)
- **ClaudeStatus:** Default refresh interval reduced from 15min to 5min (`status.cache_ttl`: 900 → 300)

---

## [0.11.0] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Sessionline:** `duration` segment added to default line 3 — shows total session runtime, giving context to the `api-duration` ratio (e.g. `api:45m (73%)` is more readable when you can see total session was `1h02m`)
- **`claudii trends`:** Rolling 7-day window replaces calendar week — always shows exactly 7 days regardless of weekday; most recent day (Today) shown first
- **`claudii trends`:** Total line now includes session count and model breakdown (`21 sessions, 5 Opus, 16 Sonnet`)
- **`claudii trends`:** Two new stat lines — `Median: $X.XX/day (30d)` and `Trend: $X/day (7d) vs $X/day (30d) ↑/↓` for spend pattern awareness

### Fixed
- **`claudii trends`:** False-reset threshold applied — cost/token deltas < 50% drop no longer treated as context compaction (same fix as `claudii cost` in v0.9.0)

### Changed
- **Sessionline:** All hardcoded ANSI escape codes replaced with named color variables (`CYAN`, `GREEN`, `RED`, etc.) — palette now explicit and maintainable
- **Sessionline:** Reduced awk subprocess forks from 8 to 2 per update — integer arithmetic now uses bash `(( ))`
- **README:** Sessionline example updated to reflect 3-line multi-segment default; cost segment removed from example
- **`claudii cost`:** Session counts and token totals removed from display — pure dollar accounting; Total label highlighted in accent color with blank line after each section
- **Internal:** Hardcoded symbols (`●`, `○`, `│`, `✓`, `✗`, `⚠`, `⚡`) replaced with `CLAUDII_SYM_*` constants; added `CLAUDII_SYM_CACHE`, `CLAUDII_SYM_FINGERPRINT`, and `CLAUDII_SYM_MONITORING` to `visual.sh`

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-04-03

### Added

- **`claudii trends`:** Daily API wait time shown per day (`api:1h23m`) — `api_duration_ms` now persisted in `history.tsv` (field 9)
- **Sessionline:** `api-duration` segment now shows ratio `api:45m (73%)` — API time as % of total session runtime
- **`claudii cost`/`claudii trends`:** Token usage tracking — `input_tok` and `output_tok` stored in `history.tsv`; displayed as `X.XK tok` / `X.XM tok` after each Total line
- **`claudii cost`:** Configurable week start via `cost.week_start` in config — supports all 7 day names (default: `monday`)
- **Sessionline:** Configurable multi-line output via `statusline.lines` in config.json — burn-eta, worktree, agent now visible on line 2 by default

### Changed
- **`claudii trends`:** "Last week" summary removed — period summaries are now exclusively in `claudii cost`; `claudii cost` is the accounting view, `claudii trends` is the visualization view
- **Sessionline:** `history.tsv` schema extended to 9 fields — `api_duration_ms` added as field 9; existing 8-field rows remain compatible (missing field treated as 0)
- **`claudii se`:** Cost removed from pretty output — use `claudii cost` for cost accounting; `--json` output retains the `cost` field
- **Release notes:** SHA256 checksum and Full Changelog compare URL appended automatically after GitHub Release is created; format simplified (no bullet lists)
- **Homebrew tap:** Auto-updated on release via polling workflow
- **Sessionline:** Segment pre-computation replaces monolithic output string; COLUMNS-based adaptive truncation removed

### Fixed
- **Release workflow:** `head_sha` filter corrected in polling step; unindented `---` no longer breaks YAML block scalar
- **Sessionline:** Duplicate `date +%s` call eliminated; `bc` subprocess in `_tok()` replaced with pure awk; `history.tsv` now correctly stores `input_tok` and `output_tok` per entry
- **`claudii cost`/`claudii trends`:** `epoch_to_date()` now applies local timezone offset — sessions near midnight no longer land on the wrong day in non-UTC timezones
- **Session Dashboard:** Sessions with `cost=0` in cache now fall back to `history.tsv` lookup — active sessions no longer show missing cost
- **`claudii status`:** Incident update timestamps correctly extracted when `<small>` contains nested `<a>` tags; blank line between updates for readability
- **`claudii cost`:** Session counts now count distinct sessions (not session-day pairs) — multi-day sessions counted once per model
- **`claudii cost`:** False context-reset detection fixed — threshold `cost < prev * 0.5` prevents floating-point noise from triggering spurious resets; Opus overcounting eliminated
- **`claudii cost`:** Week header shows date range `(YYYY-MM-DD – YYYY-MM-DD)` when week spans a month boundary

---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Loading animations:** New `lib/spinner.sh` module with three modes — beam (default: `⠋ file.sh ⠹` with 6-phase green L→R gradient), wave (full-width scrolling block-element hill), and ASCII fallback for dumb terminals. Active during `cost`, `se`, and `trends`. Spinner displays the file path currently being processed; each new file gets its own line (scrolling log effect).
- **`claudii cost`:** Model legend at top of output (`(O) Opus 4.6 · (S) Sonnet 4.6`) and per-model cost breakdown in Months and Years sections — Opus costs were previously hidden in totals.
- **`claudii se`:** Dim legend line below the summary explaining `✦ file(N)` (file access count), session-total cost, and 5h/7d API rate limit usage.

### Changed
- **`claudii trends`:** Cost attribution now uses `running_spend` algorithm — multi-day session costs correctly attributed per-day delta, not to the last active day. UTC date consistency: all date boundaries computed in UTC to match `epoch_to_date()` in awk (prevents "today" row disappearing in UTC±N timezones around midnight).
- **Performance:** `claudii trends` aggregation is now O(1) per row; was O(n) `date(1)` subprocesses per row.

### Fixed
- **`claudii cost`:** Multi-day sessions no longer attribute their full cumulative cost to the last active day. Each day now shows only the delta (last cost that day minus last cost the previous day). Backed by `history.tsv` via new `_cmd_cost_from_history()`.
- **`claudii cost`:** BSD awk (macOS) compatibility for leap-year calculation; intra-day reset accounting (context compaction mid-session no longer double-counts cost).

## [0.8.1] — 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **CI/Ubuntu:** `(( var++ ))` when var=0 exits under `set -e` on bash 5.x — all six standalone post-increment counters changed to pre-increment (`++var`)
- **Config:** `_cfgget` now handles hyphenated keys (e.g. `session-dashboard.enabled`) — builds quoted jq path per segment to avoid subtraction ambiguity

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- `claudii config theme` lists available color themes; `claudii config theme <name>` sets the active theme
- Theme schema in `config/defaults.json`: `theme` (active theme) and `theme_presets` (built-in themes: `default`, `pastel`)
- Theme loading: `_claudii_theme_load` applies color presets from config to `CLAUDII_CLR_*` vars at boot and on config reload
- `theme.name: "auto"` detects light/dark terminal via `$COLORFGBG` / `$TERM_PROGRAM` heuristics

### Changed
- `claudii dashboard` renamed to `claudii session-dashboard`; `dashboard` kept as deprecated alias
- Config key `dashboard.enabled` renamed to `session-dashboard.enabled`; old key still read as migration fallback
- Internal: `_claudii_dashboard` → `_claudii_session_dashboard`, `_CLAUDII_DASH_*` → `_CLAUDII_SDASH_*`
- Session dashboard now renders only after `claudii` commands — suppressed after `ls`, `git`, etc. for less visual noise
- Session dashboard suppression after `se`/`si`/`sessions` now uses `_CLAUDII_SHOWED_SESSIONS` flag instead of command-name matching
- Overview (`claudii`) and dashboard: rate-limit values (5h, 7d) are now color-coded by urgency — green (< 50%), yellow (50–79%), red (≥ 80%)
- Overview: reset countdown colored by urgency — dim (> 60 min), yellow (10–60 min), red (< 10 min)
- Overview: version number, today's cost, and active session bullet use `CLAUDII_CLR_ACCENT` for visual hierarchy
- `claudii config set` now recognizes float values (e.g. `watch.volume 0.5`) and stores them as JSON numbers

### Fixed
- **Security:** `osascript` notification message/title are now escaped before interpolation into AppleScript string
- **Security:** Agent names from config are validated before `eval` in `_claudii_register_agents` — prevents code injection via crafted config
- **Robustness:** All `jq` config writes now use atomic `mktemp` + `mv` pattern — config file can no longer be silently wiped on jq error
- **Robustness:** `_watch_loop` fork now exports all helper function dependencies (`_cfg_init`, `_cfgget`, `_validate_key`) — watch sound config was previously inaccessible in the subprocess
- `claudii trends` awk syntax error (missing `}` in END block)
- Session name in `claudii sessions` / bare `claudii` showing raw sed code from JSONL tool-result transcripts
- `claudii status` now shows per-update timestamps and status (Investigating/Monitoring/Resolved) from incident description when an outage is detected — the `<small>` time was previously not parsed at all; `<var>` tags inside `<small>` are now stripped before extraction
- Rate-limit display (`claudii sessions`) no longer shows `7d:%` when 7d data is absent — each value rendered independently
- `_cmd_search`: actionable error message when configured search directory doesn't exist

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- Bare `claudii` command shows smart account overview: sessions, account rate limits, agents, services
- `changelog` (shortcut: `about`) shows release notes for the current version from CHANGELOG.md
- `sessions-inactive` (shortcut: `si`) lists only inactive/stale sessions with context bar, cost, and rate-limit info
- `CLAUDII_CLR_ACCENT` constant (magenta 38;5;213m) in `lib/visual.sh`
- Helper functions: `_parse_session_cache`, `_render_ctx_bar`, `_render_age` for consistent session rendering

### Changed
- **Modular architecture:** `bin/claudii` split from 1835-line monolith into thin dispatcher (262 lines) + 4 command modules (`lib/cmd/system.sh`, `lib/cmd/sessions.sh`, `lib/cmd/display.sh`, `lib/cmd/config.sh`) + `lib/trends.awk`
- All raw `\033[` ANSI codes in `bin/claudii` replaced with `CLAUDII_CLR_*`/`CLAUDII_SYM_*` constants from `lib/visual.sh`
- All raw ANSI codes in `lib/functions.zsh` replaced with `CLAUDII_CLR_*` constants
- Sessions section uses ●/○ indicators with 8-block context bar, color-coded by usage
- Services section reflects ClaudeStatus, Dashboard, CC-Statusline, and Watch state

### Removed
- `dash` command (duplicated by `dashboard`)
- Dead command stubs: `show`, `debug`, `stats`, `continue`, `release`, `metrics`, `is`
- `bin/claudii-explore` (replaced by `/explore` skill)

### Refactored
- `_claudii_dashboard` split into `_claudii_collect_sessions`, `_claudii_render_global_line`, `_claudii_render_session_lines` (coordinator now ~30 lines)
- `_claudii_launch` rate-limit warning block extracted into `_claudii_rl_warn`

### Fixed
- **Security:** `printf '%b'` → `%s` in 3 session-rendering calls — prevents escape-sequence injection via JSONL session names
- `_session_name()` sanitizes output: strips non-printable chars, strips literal `\033[...m` sequences, trims to 60 chars
- **ANSI rendering:** `CLAUDII_CLR_*` in `lib/visual.sh`, `lib/log.sh`, `lib/config.zsh` use `$'...'` syntax (real ESC bytes); `printf` uses `%s` for color args
- Dollar sign invisible in dashboard cost display (`%{\$%}` → `'\$` in statusline.zsh)
- Loop variable `i` leaking into terminal after `sessions`/`cost` commands (renamed to `_i`)
- Printf single-quote regression: 38 printf calls with CLR vars in single quotes now use double quotes
- Awk trends colors: pass ANSI codes via `-v` args instead of inline assignments in single-quoted awk
- `local` outside function in `sessions)` block causing crash under `set -euo pipefail`
- `_claudii_agent_launch` reading wrong positional args after premature shift
- Rate limit decimal display in `sessions-inactive` (now integer)
- `clh` swallowing `claudii-status` exit code

### Tests
- 246 tests (was 236): `assert_no_literal_ansi` + `assert_matches` helpers; `assert_contains` → `grep -qF`; ANSI guards for bare claudii/sessions/cost/trends/doctor; session-name injection guard; agents/trends/cost content coverage

---

## [0.6.0] — 2025-11-01

### Added
- `agents` command: lists configured agents (alias→skill→model/effort) or shows onboarding if none configured
- `claudestatus [on|off]` command for toggling the RPROMPT ClaudeStatus layer
- `dashboard [on|off]` command for toggling the above-prompt Dashboard layer
- `cc-statusline [on|off]` replaces `sessionline` (backward-compat shim kept)
- `layers` command replaces `components` (backward-compat shim kept)
- `on` / `off` commands enable/disable all three display layers at once
- Dashboard multi-session view with detail cards, 7d-delta tracking, and toggle
- `dash show` subcommand for detailed session view
- `version` / `about` merged: interactive shows about-style output, piped shows bare version

### Changed
- `release` moved to `scripts/release.sh` (standalone script)
- `debug`, `stats`, `continue`, `explore`, `install-sessionline`, `show` commands removed (redirects added)
- Context bar uses ░ for empty blocks (was space)
- Cost display uses `$` prefix consistently

### Fixed
- Dashboard debug-variable leaks (`i=4`, `cost_fmt=35.59`) in PROMPT_SUBST context
- Dollar sign missing in dashboard cost display
- Stale sessions (empty model) no longer shown in dashboard
- Context bar empty blocks rendering correctly
